⚡ ETL Pipeline: Bronze → Silver → Gold with Airflow

This project implements an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to process raw data in three stages:
Bronze Layer → Raw ingestion
Silver Layer → Cleaning & transformations
Gold Layer → Aggregations & business-ready tables
The pipeline is self-healing ready with error handling and retry logic built into Airflow.


⚙️ How It Works

🔶 Bronze Layer
Runs autoloader.py
Ingests raw data from source into the Bronze Delta tables

🔷 Silver Layer
Executes silver transformations.ipynb
Cleans and transforms Bronze data into business-ready Silver tables

🟡 Gold Layer
Executes Gold_transformations.ipynb
Creates aggregated fact/dimension tables for analytics & dashboards
