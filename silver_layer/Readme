Silver Layer Transformations

This project implements the Silver Layer of a Data Lakehouse pipeline for an E-Commerce Data Platform with AI-Powered Self-Healing Pipelines.
The script (autoloader.py) reads curated Bronze Delta tables, applies cleaning, standardization, and transformation logic, and writes the results into the Silver Layer for downstream analytics, aggregations, and machine learning.


âš¡ Features

Reads Bronze Layer Delta Tables into temporary views.
Cleans and standardizes data by converting types, removing duplicates, and handling timestamps.
Adds metadata columns such as ingestion_timestamp.
Generates surrogate keys (customer_sk, product_sk) for dimension tables.
Writes output back into Silver Delta Tables with append mode.
Ensures schema enforcement and consistency for downstream layers (Gold / ML pipelines).
